    "This is not a 100% accurate map, but we can see HL7 v2, FHIR and EMIS are related. Similar maps can be created to other GP systems, and they are similar. One of the main reasons for this is UK GP systems were based on early HL7, so they also share similar models with many secondary care systems and laboratory systems.\n",

FHIR, on the other hand, is more focused on REST API interactions for querying data, which is something HL7 v2 doesn't support (well). As mentioned previously, we also use FHIR as the master data model as it can be converted to other standards such as HL7 v2 and XDS quite easily.\n",

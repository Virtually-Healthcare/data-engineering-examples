    "It is quite common to load in master data files from [ODS Data Search and Export](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/data-search-and-export/csv-downloads) into a computer system. The identifiers used for GP's and Organisations help identify these entities between different systems and health providers.\n",

    "NHS England provides several API's for doing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Organisation Data Terminology - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/organisation-data-terminology) which allows you to search for organisations\n",
    "- [Spine Directory Service - LDAP API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/spine-directory-service-ldap) which allows search on a wide set of MDM entities and includes most of the entities from ODS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of these entities in FHIR, ODS and SDS is very similar. This diagram is from [HL7 FHIR Administration Module](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/administration-module.html)\n",

    "So far we have a relatively simple model for our GPs and Practices both are strongly identified using national identifiers, but in practice we will have several other identifiers. Existing use of these national identifiers may not be robust and have data issues. This can occur in all EPR systems, including secondary care.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue is although GMP is defined [GENERAL MEDICAL PRACTITIONER PPD CODE](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/attributes/general_medical_practitioner_ppd_code.html) this and the other practitioner identifiers are quite frequently mixed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to handle this is beyond the scope of this walkthrough, a list of all the different practitioner identifiers can be found on [NHS North West GMSA](https://nw-gmsa.github.io/R4/StructureDefinition-EnglandPractitionerIdentifier.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Many systems will have their own strong identifier — for example, EMIS uses UUID's to identify practitioners across all its API's. Our use case is master data management, so it makes sense for us to have a record of that in our MDM solution. As suppliers are supporting operational delivery of care and that ODS is only updated quarterly (and monthly), it's likely that our Practitioner may have more details than ODS or is more up to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we need to cope with existing data, our data load needs to be repeatable (so we can schedule quarterly/monthly) runs and we can merge with existing data."

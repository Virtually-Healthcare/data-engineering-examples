The identifiers used for GP's and Organisations help identify these entities between different systems and health providers.\n",

    "- [Organisation Data Terminology - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/organisation-data-terminology) which allows you to search for organisations\n",

Our use case is master data management, so it makes sense for us to have a record of that in our MDM solution.
